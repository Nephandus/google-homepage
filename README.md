This is just the Google Homepage visual model for TheOdinProject. After the wrangling of misbehaving flexbox margin business, I gave up on implementing pretend functionality, which is a later TOP section and track focus anyway, what with the JS Basics section of the Fundamentals coming immediately after this assignment.

It's crudely aping their design sinc dev-tools barely report their elements, and I never got their Material fonts working, so I used Font Awesome, despite their lack of a 9dot-grid icon. My flexbox didn't do several things it seemed it easily should've, and I'm still unsure why some settings on that SOLE element were wrecking the ENTIRE body EVERYTIME. Putting an icon in a search form is ridiculously obtuse nowadays too. I'm assuming either overlapping the form with an image is possible, despite some people saying you can't, or they hacked off the front end of the search form and aligned an image to look like the front of the form, which seems less likely.
